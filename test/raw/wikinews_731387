13th Annual Beverly Hills film festival opens

The 2013 Beverly Hills Film Festival is set to open on Wednesday. The event will feature multiple independently produced films and screenplays. 130 screenplays have been listed as finalists in the Screenplays category. The festival spans five days, ending on May 13th. Numerous films will be screened at the festival, including the short film, "Byron's Theme". Other films include "A Thousand Kisses Deep", and "A White Mule". 

Screenwriter and indie film producer, Kara Rainer's story, entitled "RORRIM", was selected as a finalist in the screenplay category. Rainer told "Wikinews", "I am thrilled that "RORRIM" was picked with so many being selected." Rainer's story revolves largely around an old hand mirror she discovered while attending an estate sale in Dallas, Texas. 

In 2012, the festival opened with the film, "The Black Tulip", a film shot entirely in Afghanistan. That film ultimately won multiple awards at that year's festival, including Best Producer and Best Actor. Previous festival attendees read like a 'Who's Who' in Hollywood: Martin Landau, Danny Devito, and Doris Roberts, among many others. The festival will be featured at the historic Chinese 6 Theatres on Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood, California.
